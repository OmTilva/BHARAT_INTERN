# Sign-Up Form

This project implements a simple sign-up form that allows users to register by providing their name, email, and password. The system checks if the user is already registered and displays an appropriate message.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to sign up with their name, email, and password.
- **Duplicate Check**: Checks if the email is already registered and prevents duplicate registration.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Usage

1. Connect to your Databse: update line2 in user.js.
2. Open http://localhost:3000/signup in your browser.
3. Enter your name, email, and password.
4. Click "Sign Up".
5. If the email is already registered, a message "User already exists" will be displayed. Otherwise, the user will be registered successfully.
